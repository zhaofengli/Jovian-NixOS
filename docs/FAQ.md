> What's Jupiter?

[There's a disambiguation page that won't help you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_(disambiguation)).
It's not known *exactly* what it's the codename for.
It is either the codename for the Steam Deck, or the codename for the new Steam OS for the Steam Deck.
Things get awfully murky with *Neptune* also being a thing, and it's unclear from the outside what it is.
To the best of our knowledge, Jupiter is the OS.

> What channels are supported?

Truthfully, no channel is *supported*, but the older the stable release was cut, the more likely the additions from Jovian NixOS won't work as expected.

Thus, it is preferable to use `nixos-unstable`. The latest update *should* work fine, and when it doesn't, it'll be handled soon enough.
